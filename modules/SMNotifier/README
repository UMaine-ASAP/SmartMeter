Smart Meter Notifications Module:

The SmartMeter Notifications Module is a component for the the Bangor Hydro Electric's SmartMeter website that will allow site users to receive text message or email alerts to a cell phone or email address respectively.  These alerts can be generated by almost anything on the site, from goals that are near completion or overdue to major changes in electricity consumption or break even periods for electrical equipment.

Cost:
The current prototype of the notifications system utilizes a service called Twilio to act as a gateway between the code and the phone network.  This service allows the sending of text messages at a cost of 1Â¢ per text message.  There are possible alternatives that would be free, however these gateways are run by individual cell providers, so some user cell phones using alternative providers or services (example: Google Voice) would not be supported.  There may also be a send limit on this latter method of sending.  Free alternatives have not been researched yet, but can be.  Email notifications are handled by the website server, and will cost nothing extra.
